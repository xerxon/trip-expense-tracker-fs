# Trip Expense Tracker

The sample app built in the L4 AI Developer Training. A user registers, creates a trip, adds the people on it, and records who paid for what. The app shows what each person owes or is owed, and the fewest payments needed to settle up. See [docs/specs/product.md](docs/specs/product.md) for the full requirements.

Over four weeks you build it with Claude Code: specs and plans (Week 1), a developer agent (Week 2), pull requests and an AI reviewer (Week 3), and an orchestrator that runs the loop (Week 4). Every session runs on Haiku, within a $15 budget.

## Prerequisites

- **[Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)** on your `PATH` (`claude --version`).
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (current LTS) on your `PATH` (`node --version`). The hooks and the setup script run with Node.
- **Git** and a **GitHub account**. On Windows, install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win); it includes Git Bash, which Claude Code uses to run hook commands.
- **The GitHub CLI** (`gh --version`), signed in once with `gh auth login`.
  - Windows: `winget install --id GitHub.cli`. If `winget` isn't recognised, run `& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\WindowsApps\winget.exe" install --id GitHub.cli`, or use the installer from [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com).
  - Mac: `brew install gh`.
- **An OpenRouter API key**, from your course organiser or [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai).

## Getting started

1. **Create your private repository from this template and clone it.** On a Mac, work from your home folder (`cd ~`), not Desktop or Documents.

   ```bash
   gh repo create trip-expense-tracker --template FS-ClaricePocot/trip-expense-tracker-starter --private --clone
   ```

   Then add your mentor as a collaborator: on GitHub, open your repository's **Settings → Collaborators → Add people**.

2. **Connect Claude Code to OpenRouter.** From the repository root, run the setup script and paste your key when asked (the input is hidden):

   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-openrouter.mjs
   ```

   It saves the key and the OpenRouter address to `.claude/settings.local.json`, which is git-ignored and applies to this project only. Your key is never committed.

3. **Check the connection.** Open a new terminal in the repository root and run `claude`. If you're logged in to a Claude account, run `/logout` first. Then:
   - `/status` shows the base URL `https://openrouter.ai/api`
   - `/model` shows Haiku

4. **Start Week 1** on its own branch:

   ```bash
   git switch -c week-1
   ```

## What's in this repository

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `docs/specs/product.md` | The product requirements and the MVP feature list |
| `docs/rules/project-rules.md` | Coding, testing, logging, security and review rules |
| `.claude/settings.json` | The hooks and the Haiku model. No key |
| `.claude/hooks/` | The session-log hook and two warnings (context size, task committed) |
| `.claude/skills/spec-feature/` | The given `/spec-feature` skill and its spec template |
| `scripts/setup-openrouter.mjs` | Saves your OpenRouter key outside git |
| `docs/activities-outputs/` | Your session logs (automatic) and screenshots |

You add the rest week by week: `CLAUDE.md` (your stack and test commands), the specs and plans, the skills and agent, the app in `app/`, and the GitHub workflow.

## Repository structure

Keep to this layout, so every participant's repository looks the same and mentors can find things quickly. Use these exact names. Only the inside of `app/` differs, depending on your stack.

Name specs and plans by feature ID and a short name in kebab-case, for example `docs/specs/features/F3-people.md` and `docs/plans/F3-people.md`. Name branches `week-1` and `week-2`, then by feature in Weeks 3 and 4, using the same name as the plan (for example `F3-people`).

## Ground rules

1. **Start Claude Code from the repository root**, so it loads the settings, skills and hooks. Sessions started elsewhere are not logged.
2. **Stay within the $15 budget.** Every session counts.
3. **Use Haiku only**, for every session, skill and agent.
4. **One task per session.** Run `/clear` between tasks. Long, open-ended chats are the most common cause of overspending.
5. **Work through pull requests.** In Weeks 1 and 2, do the week's work on one branch (`week-1`, `week-2`) and open one pull request for it. In Weeks 3 and 4, use one branch and one pull request per feature (for example `F3-people`), so each AI review stays small and cheap. Your mentor reviews each pull request, then you merge.
6. **Keep evidence.** Commit your session logs and screenshots in `docs/activities-outputs/`.

## Session logs and warnings

Every Claude Code session in this project is logged to `docs/activities-outputs/session-logs/` by [.claude/hooks/session-log.mjs](.claude/hooks/session-log.mjs). It runs after every turn and when the session ends. There is nothing to set up beyond the prerequisites.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `YYYY-MM-DD-<session id>.md` | One per session: start and last activity time, prompt and task counts, models, token usage (main conversation and subagents), each task's tokens, and the skills and agents used |
| `.hook-errors.log` | Only appears if the hook hit an error. Not committed (see `.gitignore`) |

What to know:

- **Your prompts are never recorded.** Each task is described from Claude's side: its plan steps if it made a plan, otherwise the opening sentence of its reply, otherwise the tools it used (e.g. `Tools: Bash ×2, Edit ×1`). A slash command is shown in front, e.g. `/spec-feature: …`.
- **Logs are committed** as evidence of each session's models and token use. Commit them with the work they belong to. A session that is still open keeps rewriting its log, so commit it after the session ends.
- **Files are regenerated; don't edit them.** Each run rebuilds the log from the session transcript.
- **Dates use your local time zone.**

Two more hooks show a one-line warning after a reply. The warnings appear only to you and aren't sent to the model, so they cost no tokens:

- **Context warning:** at about 80k tokens, and every 40k after that, you're told to finish or commit the current task, then run `/clear` (or `/compact` to keep a short summary). Change the thresholds with `CONTEXT_WARN_TOKENS` and `CONTEXT_WARN_STEP`, or turn it off with `CONTEXT_WARN_OFF=1`.
- **Task reminder:** after you commit a plan task (a commit message starting `F<N>.T<k>`, such as `F1.T2`), you're reminded to run `/clear` before the next task. Turn it off with `TASK_REMINDER_OFF=1`.

To log a session by hand:

```bash
node .claude/hooks/session-log.mjs --transcript <path-to-session.jsonl>
```

To exclude a session, add its full session id (one per line, `#` for comments) to `.claude/hooks/session-log.ignore`; its log is removed on the next run.

If logs stop appearing, check `docs/activities-outputs/session-logs/.hook-errors.log`, or run the hook with `SESSION_LOG_DEBUG=1` set to print errors.
